        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a freshman at the Univeristy of California, Riverside. During my free time I enjoy playing sports, listening to music, and working out. Before college I played 4 years of soccer in high school as well as 2 years of football. I was also apart of many clubs in high school, one of which was The National Honor Society of which I became President of heading into my senior year. I am the youngest of 6 all of which are half-siblings of mine. I have four step-sisters and one step-brother and am also only the third one to ever attend college. Over the last 4 years I have worked only 2 jobs one of which stems from a small business I created that revolves around selling shoes as well as clothes.   <br><br>

        Upon graduating from college I would like to take everything that I learned and put it towards becoming a real estate agent. I would describe myself as someone who is very hard-working and dedicated. When I put my mind to something I don’t stop working until whatever I want to accomplish is accomplished. For this I would have to take my parents, especially my mom. My mom at a very young age has always taught me to keep a strong mindset and if I want something to go get it. She has also told me should be very grateful for everything I have as well as to always stay humble. I believe that no matter where life takes me after college I will succeed because of the work hard mindset I have.<br><br>

The reason why becoming a real estate agent interest me once graduating from college is because I have always had an entrepreneurship mindset. Since my freshman year of high school I have sold shoes and clothes online and through social media as a way of making money. Through selling shoes and clothes I was able to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset. Being a real estate agent in my opinion is very much a job for people who want to become entrepreneurs. When you become a real estate agent your income depends on how many houses you can sell. The more houses you sell in a month the higher your income for that month will be. On the other hand if you don’t sell enough houses you can find yourself struggling. In a sense you are your own boss and after all that is what being an entrepreneur is. Along with having to work hard in the real estate business, becoming an agent means you get to help other families and individuals find their "forever home." For someone like me this is very satisfying because it means that you are helping people out in the world. Lastly I would like to become a real estate agent because it will set me up to eventually one day start up my own real estate busines.

      If you would like to contact me please feel free to do so through my LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, or email, All of which are located below. Thank you and hope to be hearing from you soon.
